# Analysis of Trends in E-sports
eSports is a form of high level gaming that involves competing for prize money or
notoriety. eSports are played in the format of team vs team, or solo player vs solo player. Many
of the most popular games can have tournaments with prize pools up to a million dollars.
eSports creates a new potential market for game developers to target, with developers being
one of the main groups to consistently profit from a thriving eSports scene, as well as several
teams having created valuable companies off the back of eSports success. Given all of this
information, our team is taking on the problem of determining patterns within the eSports and
overall video game infrastructure that can work to benefit groups such as players, developers,
and teams as much as possible. eSports is a field where many people find community and
enjoyment as well as being able to make careers, and this analysis could help improve the lives
of all those people. We have aggregated data from several sources such as
EsportEarnings.com and sullygnome.com and performed analysis on this data to try and
address our fundamental data science question: What does general eSports data show us
about how teams, players, and developers can invest their time and resources to find the best
return on their investments
